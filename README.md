<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Thumbnail showing the landing of the app](resources/thumbnail_1.PNG)

I've been thinking about sustainability a lot lately. Especially how my own habits are impacting the environment. This had me quit shopping for new clothes in the first 6 months of the year. But it also got me curious about what the companies I go to for products and services are doing. And so I came up with this: `climateticker`. This `v1` is a simple proof of concept. It's a fun little CLI app that allows to know what the largest public companies in the world are doing to reach net-zero.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/LucasNseyep/climateticker-v1.git
   ```
2. Install gems
   ```sh
   bundle install
   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
The project started with the idea that curious individuals or concerned citizens like myself would want to check what big companies are doing.

However, I found that the users that could make the most of the tool are Business Development Representatives (BDRs) working for carbon accounting platforms researching their clients.
